  Research, create, improve, migrate, evaluate, package, install-check, govern, and safely publish HugAILab agent skills from workflows, prompts, transcripts, docs, SOPs, runbooks, scripts, or notes. Use for new or existing skills, prior-art synthesis, routing/trigger boundaries, trigger or output evals, Skill IR, release gates, README preparation, GitHub repository and pull-request publication, versioned Releases, clean npx installation, team reuse, and create-and-publish flows. The publication path is self-contained and forbids direct default-branch pushes. Exclude one-off summaries, translations, ordinary docs, non-skill package publishing, and tasks that explicitly should not become a skill.

# HugAILab Meta Skill

Build reusable HugAILab skill packages, not long prompts.

## Router Rules

- Route by frontmatter `description` first.
- Once selected, `hugailab-meta-skill` is the single authoring authority. Do not also invoke a generic `skill-creator` unless the user explicitly requests comparison or this skill is unavailable.
- Built-in prior-art discovery belongs to this skill. Do not install, load, or delegate to a separate discovery skill.
- Built-in GitHub publishing belongs to this skill. Do not require or invoke a separate publisher skill after this package is selected.
- Keep the package root `SKILL.md` to routing and the minimal workflow. Put judgment in `references/`, deterministic behavior in `scripts/`, regression cases in `evals/`, and evidence in `reports/`.
- A package has one discoverable root `SKILL.md`; embedded examples and fixtures use `SKILL.example.md` or `SKILL.fixture.md`.
- Do not turn one-off summaries, translations, explanations, or brainstorming into skills.
- Match the user's action: create/refactor/package requests may edit; audit/evaluate/diagnose-only requests remain read-only; publish only when explicitly requested.
- Default to concise Chinese-first names; apply a user/team prefix only when requested.
- Add a copyright/LICENSE line for the owning user or team; never inject third-party profiles, QR assets, or donation links unless explicitly requested.

## Modes

- `Scaffold`: exploratory or personal; minimum useful files.
- `Production`: team reuse; README, interface, trigger eval, output contract, and install evidence.
- `Library`: shared infrastructure; Production plus Skill IR, portability, trust, and review cadence.
- `Governed`: public or high-trust; Library plus permission, rollback, secret, release, and claim gates.

Choose proportionally with [Operating Modes](references/operating-modes.md), [Gate Selection](references/gate-selection.md), and [QA Ladder](references/qa-ladder.md).

## Built-In Prior-Art Discovery

Before a new skill or substantial redesign, run 2–4 intent-shaped queries through the unified runner:

```bash
python3 scripts/research_prior_art.py "<query 1>" "<query 2>" --strict --summary --output reports/prior-art-candidates.json
```

Its underlying catalog calls remain:

```bash
npx --yes skills find "<query>"
python3 scripts/search_skillsmp.py "<query>" --limit 20 --sort stars
```

Then: keep metrics separate (skills.sh installs ≠ SkillsMP stars ≠ user ratings); deduplicate by canonical repository/skill path; shortlist popularity/trust/complementary anchors and inspect source before adoption; synthesize `keep / adapt / reject / invent`; preserve dated evidence in `reports/prior-art-research.md` for Production+.

If a catalog fails, continue with the other sources, record `missing evidence`, and lower the claim. Full method: [Prior-Art Research](references/prior-art-research.md).

## Generalization Gate

Before promoting one failure into a core rule: restate it as a domain-neutral behavior; classify it as core mechanism, optional adapter, or eval-only fixture; promote only safety/factual/permission invariants or behaviors repeated across unrelated domains; keep one-off details in fixtures; then rerun original and unrelated boundary cases.

Prefer intent fidelity, source fidelity, and decision rules over an expanding topic encyclopedia.

## HugAILab Skill OS

1. `Intent`: recurring job, users, inputs, output, exclusions, standards, references.
2. `Skill IR`: platform-neutral meaning and evidence boundary.
3. `Package`: lean root instructions, interface, README, and earned resources.
4. `Eval`: trigger boundaries first; output/runtime/human eval when risk justifies it.
5. `Review`: package, context, trust, install, README, and public claims.
6. `Operate`: explicit feedback, failures, drift, and next-iteration proposals without raw private content.

## Compact Workflow

1. Decide whether the request deserves a reusable skill; otherwise answer directly and create no package.
2. Capture job, finished output, target users, inputs, exclusions, permissions, standards, existing assets, platforms, and publication intent.
3. Pass prior-art discovery or record `missing evidence`; pass the generalization gate for sample-driven changes; choose the lightest valid mode.
4. Write the `description` early; run `evals/trigger_cases.json` before expanding structure; create only earned resources.
5. Export `reports/skill-ir.json` for Production+; add output evals when trigger tests alone cannot show correctness, safety, or repeatability.
6. Keep mutations inside the requested action boundary and preserve rollback for risky changes.
7. Validate package, unit tests, trigger behavior, context budget, secret/trust boundaries, and evidence claims; produce the creation handoff with clearly labeled missing evidence.
8. When publication is requested, read [Self-Contained Skill Publishing](references/publishing.md), then use the bundled publisher for feature branch → validation → PR → merge → release/install verification; never push directly to the default branch.

Core commands:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_skill.py .
python3 scripts/export_skill_ir.py . --output reports/skill-ir.json
python3 scripts/trigger_eval.py . --cases evals/trigger_cases.json --output reports/trigger-eval.json
python3 scripts/release_check.py . --phase local --run-tests
python3 scripts/score_skill.py . --output reports/scorecard.json --report reports/scorecard.md
python3 scripts/publish_skill.py /path/to/skill --dry-run
```

## Gate Ladder

- `Scaffold`: valid frontmatter, useful README hook, natural triggers, explicit exclusions.
- `Production`: Scaffold plus interface, trigger eval, output contract, troubleshooting, root isolation, and install verification.
- `Library`: Production plus Skill IR, portability, trust, review cadence, and evidence artifacts.
- `Governed`: Library plus permission/rollback boundary, secret scan, dangerous-pattern scan (`skill_pattern_scan`), output or integrity-preserving human evidence, and public-claim guard.

Unavailable telemetry, provider runs, approval, install proof, or human review must remain `missing evidence`; planned work is not proof. See [Review And Release Gates](references/review-release-gates.md) and [Resource Boundary Spec](references/resource-boundaries.md).

## Output Contract

For package-producing requests, provide only what the selected mode earns:

1. working skill directory and trigger-aware root `SKILL.md`
2. aligned `agents/interface.yaml`
3. human-facing README for shared/public skills
4. trigger cases and generated trigger report for Production+
5. Skill IR, prior-art report, and creation handoff for Production+
6. optional references, scripts, output evals, reports, and manifest when they improve judgment, repeatability, or evidence
7. publish artifacts only when publishing was requested

The final creation handoff must name the **reference skills studied**, give **candidate-specific lessons**, explain deliberate rejections and original contributions, and label each highlight as **design advantage**, **validated advantage**, or **hypothesis**. Never claim global superiority without a fair comparison. Use [Creation Handoff](references/creation-handoff.md).

## Publish Flow

1. Treat README as a product page: value, install, natural examples, prerequisites, outputs, configuration, risks, and troubleshooting.
2. Audit without mutation when useful (`--dry-run`); run the full publisher only after an explicit publish request.
3. The bundled publisher prepares MIT LICENSE and README without third-party branding; resolves identity; blocks secrets and reused versions; creates or reuses a repository; publishes only through a feature branch and PR; merge is blocked by conflicts, failed/pending checks, or requested changes.
4. Do not report publication complete until the remote default version, GitHub Release, discovery and clean installation are verified.

## Creator Defaults

- Prefer practical, concise, publishable Chinese output.
- 新 skill 默认命名 `hugailab-` 前缀（如 `hugailab-xxxxx`、`hugailab-xxx-xxxx`，前缀后最多 5 段）；`new_skill.py` 自动补前缀，用户显式要求其他前缀时遵循用户。
- Keep one creator authority and one root skill entrypoint.
- Preserve platform-neutral source plus minimal adapters.
- Branding-free by default: published packages contain no author profile, QR, or donation assets.
- Public claims must match trigger, output, runtime, install, or human evidence actually present.
- Upstream ideas are adopted semantically with attribution, not mirrored wholesale.
